# trash-detection-dataset
Inside this repo, you'll find a rich collection of data that consists of 5 distinct classes of trash materials: metal, glass, cardboard, paper, and plastic.

Our trash dataset is a comprehensive collection that has been meticulously curated to include a wide variety of examples for each class. This is to ensure that the dataset is both diverse and representative of real-world scenarios.

Along with the dataset, we have included xml and txt label files. These labels have been designed to make the dataset suitable for object detection, making it easy for researchers and developers to use it to train and test their models. The xml and txt labels provide detailed information on each image, including the location and class of each object in the image.
